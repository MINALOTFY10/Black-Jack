A simplified version of the popular card game Blackjack made by Java (using OOP).


The Java project is a simple implementation of the popular card game Blackjack, written using object-oriented programming principles.

The game begins with three players and a dealer each dealt two cards. While both players' cards are visible, only one of the dealer's cards is shown. The objective of the game is to have a total card value (score) in your hand as close to 21 or exactly 21 (BLACKJACK) without going over. 

Players take turns to either Hit (draw another card) or Stand (end their turn) based on their current score. 
If a player's score exceeds 21, they lose the game (BUSTED).
The dealer will start hitting until their score reaches 21, has a score greater than all of the players, or BUSTS. 
If more than one player has the same high score, it's a tie (PUSH), but if only one player has the highest score, they win the game. 

The game can be summarized into four steps: 
1. deck creation
2. initial card draw
3. player turns, dealer turn
4. decision making.
